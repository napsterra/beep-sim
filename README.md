# Beeping Simulator

Or "FNF Character Test" LOL, I just want to call it like that HAHAHAHA, anyways, I made this to view or to test those atlas sprites in FNF.  


## How do I run this?

To run this, download the source code first, then you can use XAMPP or http-server to localhost this, or you can just go to [this page](https://hiromon211.github.io/beep-sim/).
